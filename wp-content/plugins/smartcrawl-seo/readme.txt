== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Other SEO plugins only guarantee support for Premium subscribers. Is SmartCrawl fully-supported? =
We have dedicated staff that provide world-class support on the WordPress forums for all our free plugins. If you don’t want to wait, upgrade for real-time live chat support 24/7/365

= I added new titles in SmartCrawl and Google is still showing my old titles and descriptions. What gives!? =
If you've recently updated your titles and description, Google probably hasn't indexed them just yet. It can take up to a week for Google to index changes you’ve made.

Use the “New Crawl” button in the sitemap tab to notify Google of any changes to your site. The Google cache will update when your site has be recrawled. Be patient, it can take some time for the new information to show.

= Does SmartCrawl work with Custom Post Types? =
Yes, it does! SmartCrawl SEO has full support for custom post types, both in overall management tools (Settings > Title&Meta), as well as in the editor. Plus it works out of the box with both built-in and custom taxonomies.

= Does SmartCrawl work with content in page builders like Visual Composer or Beaver Builder? =
SmartCrawl works with any normal WP content and page builders shouldn’t be an exception. As long as your theme uses posts, pages and custom post types, SmartCrawl will work.
