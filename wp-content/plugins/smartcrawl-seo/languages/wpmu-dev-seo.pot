"Your SEO title is the most important element because it is what users will "
"see in search engine results. You'll want to make sure that you have your "
"focus keywords in there, that it's a nice length, and that people will want "
"to click on it. Best practices suggest keeping your titles between %2$d and "
"%3$d characters including spaces, though in some cases 60 is the sweetspot. "
"The length is important both for SEO ranking but also how your title will "
"show up in search engines - long titles will be cut off visually and look "
"bad. Unfortunately there isn't a rule book for SEO titles, just remember to "
"make your title great for SEO but also (most importantly) readable and "
"enticing for potential visitors to click on."
